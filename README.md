#### **Description:**
This task involves understanding the basic data types in Python such as list, dictionaries and sets.

#### **Responsibility:**
Write a Python program to create a list, a dictionary and a set. Perform basic operations like adding, removing and modifying elements.

### **Task-2: Data Manipulation with Pandas.**
#### **Description:**
This task involves using the Pandas library to manipulate data.
#### **Responsibility:**
Load a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. Perform operations like filtering data based on conditions, handling missing values and calculating summary statistics.

### **Task-3: Data Visualization with Matplotlib.**
#### **Description:**
This task involves using the Matplotlib library to visualize data.

Create visualization to understand the distribution of variables, identify outliers and check for correlations between variables.

### **Task-5: The Heart Disease Analysis Project**
#### **Description:**
The Heart Disease Analysis project involves analysing a dataset related to heart disease to identify key factors that contribute to heart disease occurrence. The goal is to use data analytics techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health indicators such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure and other relevant features. The analysis aims to provide insights that can help in early diagnosis and prevention.
#### **Responsibility:**
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing data, outliers and inconsistencies to ensure the dataset was suitable for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):** Performed EDA to understand the distribution of data, relationships between variables.
3. **Question Formulation:** Developed specific minimum 7 questions related to heart disease and solve each question by using appropriate function.
4. **Data Visualization:** Created visualization using tool like Matplotlib, Seaborn to effectively present the findings and insights gained from the analysis. This included charts, graphs and other visual aids to make the results easy to understand.

### **Task-6: Disney+ Movies Data Science Project**
